## Introduction

This repository provides practical examples to help you understand and harness the power of smart pointers in C++. Smart pointers are a type of C++ resource management that provide automatic memory management and help prevent common memory-related bugs.

## Smart Pointers Overview

Learn about the basics of smart pointers, how they differ from raw pointers, and the advantages they offer in terms of memory management and safety.

## Unique Pointer

Explore the unique pointer, which is a smart pointer that ensures exclusive ownership of a dynamically allocated object.

## Shared Pointer

Discover the shared pointer, a smart pointer that allows multiple pointers to share ownership of the same dynamically allocated object.

## Weak Pointer

Understand the weak pointer, a companion to the shared pointer, designed to break circular references and prevent memory leaks.

## Usage

To run the examples on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CppSmartPointersDemo.git`
2. Navigate to the desired example directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ filename.cpp -o output`
4. Run the compiled executable, e.g., `./output`

Please refer to the specific example's README for more detailed instructions and prerequisites.
